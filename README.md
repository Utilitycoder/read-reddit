# Why This Project?

## This project is currnently not working as intended due to reddit API policy change.

This simple CLI project is built to enable me read the top topics in my favorite sub (rust) without leaving my text editor. I can see if there's any interesting discussion I should check out without getting distracted by Reddit.

This project is a work-in-progress. I will add more features as soon as I find the need for it. For now, it serves its purpose - be involved without geting involved!

## Installation

To install this project, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download Rust from the official website [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can clone the repository and build the project using the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/utititycoder/read-reddit.git
cd repo
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to provide the subreddit name as a command line argument. For example, to get the top topics from the Rust subreddit, you would run the following command:

``` sh
cargo run [subreddit]
```

This will output the top topics in the Rust subreddit and their urls to the standard output.

## Contributing

I welcome anything that improves this project. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues with this project, please submit an issue.

Thank you for using my Rust project for outputting top Reddit topics in a specific subreddit to the standard output.
